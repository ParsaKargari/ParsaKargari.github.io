# Parsa

Welcome to my blog! I'm Parsa, a Software Engineering student at the University of Calgary. Born and raised in Dubai, with roots in Iran, I've been fortunate enough to experience a blend of diverse cultures.

## My Journey in Software Development

My journey in software development is driven by a passion for learning and a desire to give back. This blog is a reflection of that ethos - a place where I share knowledge, insights, and experiences in software engineering with friends, teammates, and anyone interested in the field.

### My Expertise and Interests

While I have a knack for Fullstack development, my primary expertise lies in Frontend technologies. My toolkit includes languages like JavaScript, Swift, Python, C/C++, and Java, and I'm proficient in databases like MySQL. The tech world is constantly evolving, and so is my learning journey!

### Professional Experiences

I've had the opportunity to intern as a Software Developer for four months and also engage in a Research Position in Software Security at my university. Currently, I'm leading the Geomatics Software team for Team Relectric and working as a Software Developer for Techstart. Each of these experiences has enriched my skill set and broadened my understanding of real-world applications.

## Beyond the Code

Life isn't all about coding, though. I love reading ‚Äî it's a way to live many lives in one lifetime. Traveling is another passion; it's about discovering new places, cultures, and, most importantly, discovering myself. Since moving to Canada in January 2022, I've been embracing the challenges and joys of figuring out life with help from my friends. I've recently found cooking to be a great way to unwind and relax, and I'm always looking for new recipes to try out.

_one of my favorite days - 2023 Orientation_

I believe the world is vast and interconnected, and kindness is the thread that weaves us closer. Giving back and helping others isn't just an act of kindness; it's a responsibility. Through this blog, I aim to contribute my part, share my knowledge, and perhaps teach someone something new.
