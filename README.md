# Overview

Hi! This is where I share insights, techniques, and tutorials on programming and software development. This platform is my way of giving back to the community, helping others learn and grow in their coding journey.

## About the Blog

As a Software Developer, I often come across various challenges and learning opportunities. This is a space where I document these experiences and share them with the community. From in-depth tutorials to quick tips, this blog covers a wide range of topics that I find interesting and useful.

## Using the Blog Template

If you're interested in using this blog as a template for your own projects, I'm honored! Here's how you can add posts and customize the blog for your own use:

### Adding Posts

1. Create a Markdown file for your post in the `public/posts` directory.
2. Add the front matter at the top of the file with the post's metadata (title, date, read time, tags, author, description).
3. Write your content in Markdown below the front matter.
4. Update the `index.json` in the `public/posts` directory with the filename of your new post.

### Customizing the Template

Feel free to dive into the code and make any adjustments to suit your style. The project is structured to be straightforward and customizable.

## Tech Stack

This blog is built using the following technologies:

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Material-UI**: For styling and theming the components.
- **gray-matter**: To parse the front matter from Markdown files.
- **markdown-to-jsx**: To convert Markdown into React components.
