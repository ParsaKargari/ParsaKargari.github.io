## Using the Blog Template

I'm thrilled that you're considering using this blog as a template! Here's a guide to help you customize and add your own content:

### Adding Posts

1. Create a Markdown file in `public/posts`. Name the file to match the post's slug.
2. At the top of the file, include the following metadata:

   ```
   ---
   title: "Your Post Title"
   slug: "your-post-slug"
   date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
   tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2", "Tag3"]
   author: "Your Name"
   description: "A brief summary of your post."
   ---
   ```

   Ensure the `.md` file name matches the slug in the metadata.
3. Write your content in Markdown below the metadata.
4. Update `index.json` in `public/posts` with the slug of your new post under "posts".
